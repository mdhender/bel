# BEL
Just another implmentation.

# DOCS
You can find documentation for `bel` from Paul Graham's web [site](http://www.paulgraham.com/bel.html).

# HISTORY
Logic for `bel` is derived from `schism`,
which is derived from `Mini-Scheme` by Atushi Moriwaki and Akira Kida,
which is derived from Matsuda and Saigo.

The source for `bel` is in the file `/source.bel`.
That is copied from [here](https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bel.bel?t=1570993483&).
I didn't find a license for it from his site, so treat as his, all rights reserved.
